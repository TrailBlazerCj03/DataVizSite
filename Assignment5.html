<p> I would like to compare the differences between residential FAR and Commercial FAR and I select 15 different Manhattan neighborhoods. After showing the data in horizontal bars, I find that the selected neighborhoods' ratio (Residential FAR / Commercial FAR) mostly located between 1 and 100 except Neighborhood 'Hamiltion Heights'. Through the comparison, I suspect that the neighborhood Hamiltion Heights locates in Uppertown,as it has fewer commercial space and storefronts.

On the other hand, from these data, we can learn that for a certain type of city,there is a range of 'balance value' in residential FAR to commericial FAR. Manhattan is really a commercial place as most of ratio is less than 10. Further more, if the ratio of most of the neighborhoods in one city is less than 10, we dare to say that it is a commercial city based on the situation in Manhattan.<p/>
